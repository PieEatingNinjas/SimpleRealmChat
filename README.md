## Very simple  Xamarin chat-like app that uses Realm.
The main purpose of this code is to demonstrate how we can use Realm's *PermissionOffer* and *PermissionOfferResponse* objects to invite other users to our **Realm** data store by using a **QR Code**.
The QR code is generated and scanned by using the *ZXING libray*.
