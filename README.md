## Very simple  Xamarin chat-like app that uses Realm.
The main purpose of this code is to demonstrate how we can use Realm's updated api (1.5) to create and accept PermissionOffers to invite other users to our **Realm** data store by using a **QR Code**.
The QR code is generated and scanned by using the *ZXING libray*.
